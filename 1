1. A model which is used to understand the design of a data structure to 
indicate an implementation-independent view of the data structure is: 
(a) Linear data type
(b) Non- linear data type
(c) Abstract data type
(d) Primitive data type

The model which is used to understand the design of a data structure to indicate an implementation-independent view of the data structure is an Abstract data type (ADT). ADT defines a set of data and operations on that data. The implementation details of an ADT are hidden from the user, allowing them to focus on the functionality of the data structure rather than its implementation. This makes it easier to design, understand, and modify complex data structures.

Therefore, the correct answer is (c) Abstract data type.

2. Which one of the following search algorithms cannot be applied to a sorted 
linked list? 
 (a) Sequential search algorithm
(b) Iterative search algorithm
(c) Recursive search algorithm
(d) Binary search algorithm

(a) Sequential search algorithm can be applied to a sorted linked list.

Sequential search algorithm works by iterating through the list and comparing each element to the target value until a match is found or the end of the list is reached. While this algorithm may not be the most efficient for a sorted list, it can still be applied.

(b) Iterative search algorithm can also be applied to a sorted linked list.

Iterative search algorithm is similar to sequential search algorithm, but it uses a loop to iterate through the list. Like sequential search algorithm, it compares each element to the target value until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.

(c) Recursive search algorithm can be applied to a sorted linked list.

Recursive search algorithm is a variant of the binary search algorithm that uses recursion to divide the list in half and search the appropriate half recursively. This algorithm can be used on a sorted linked list, as long as the appropriate modifications are made to handle linked list traversal.

(d) Binary search algorithm is the algorithm that cannot be applied to a sorted linked list.

Binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the sorted list in half and comparing the target value to the middle element of the current sub-list. This algorithm requires random access to the elements of the list, which is not possible with a linked list. Binary search algorithm can be used on arrays, but not on linked lists.

3. In a queue an element can be added arbitrarily and from which only either 
the smallest or largest element can be removed, the type of the queue is: 
(a) Circular queue
(b) Priority queue
(c) Deques 
(d) Ordinary queue

b) Priority queue.

In a priority queue, elements are added arbitrarily but each element is associated with a priority. The priority determines the order in which elements are removed from the queue. The highest priority element is removed first in a max priority queue, while the lowest priority element is removed first in a min priority queue. Therefore, priority queue allows for removing either the smallest or largest element depending on the type of priority queue being used.

4. Postfix notation is also known as: 
(a) Reverse polish notation
(b) Polish notation
(c) Infix notation
(d) Reverse notation

(a) Reverse polish notation

Which one of the following structure is not used for storing strings? 
(a) Fixed-length- structures
(b) Variable-length- structure with fixed maximums
(c) Variable-length- structure with fixed minimums
(d) Linked- structures

(a) Fixed-length structures are not commonly used for storing strings, as the length of the string may vary and it may waste space to allocate a fixed amount of memory. Instead, variable-length structures are typically used for storing strings. Therefore, the answer is (a) Fixed-length structures.

6. What is the throughput, if Bus clock is 8.33 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 , 32 bit-data wide 
(parallel), synchronous mode? 
(a) 269 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀
(b) 267 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀
(c) 33 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀
(d) 31 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀�

The throughput can be calculated as:

Throughput = Bus clock frequency x Data width

In this case, the bus clock frequency is 8.33 MHz and the data width is 32 bits, so:

Throughput = 8.33 MHz x 32 bits = 266.56 Mbps

Therefore, the closest option is (b) 267 mbps.

7. Few addressing modes, fixed instruction size and use more registers for 
separate memory operations are the features of: 
 (a) CISC
(b) RISC
(c) RAID
(d) DMA

The features described, such as few addressing modes, fixed instruction size, and use of more registers for separate memory operations, are characteristics of the Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture.

Therefore, the correct option is (b) RISC.

CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) architecture, on the other hand, has a larger instruction set that includes complex instructions that can perform multiple operations in a single instruction.

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a data storage technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into a single logical unit for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.

DMA (Direct Memory Access) is a technique used by computer systems to transfer data from external devices directly to memory, bypassing the CPU.
